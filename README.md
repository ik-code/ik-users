* Author: [Ihor Khaletskyi](http://wp.medi-com.info)
* Project URI on github.com: <https://github.com/ik-code/ik-users>

The plugin  sends an HTTP request to a REST API endpoint. 
The API is available at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and the endpoint to call is /users.

The plugin  parses the JSON response and uses it to build and display an HTML table on dashboard Wordpress ik-users page.

Each row in the HTML table will show the details for a user. There are column's: id, name, username, more details links.

When a visitor clicks any of these links, the details of that user will be shown. 
For that, the plugin will do API request to the user-details endpoint.

These details fetching requests are asynchronous (AJAX) and the user details will be shown without reloading the page.
At any time, the page will show details for at max one user. 
In fact, at every link click, a new user detail will load, replacing the one currently shown.
